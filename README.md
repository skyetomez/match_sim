# match_sim
This is a matching simulation based on dating preferences mentioned in a Quartz Article. This serves as a visualization of what those rates mean for couples as a way to put these percentages into context. Assumptions will be outlined later. 

I've chosen to do this in `pygame` instead of `simpy` for the visual effects as well as the collision boxes.  

## TO DO

* define time period 
* get counts of successful matches 
* get match rates
